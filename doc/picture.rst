SYNOPSIS
========

  **image create picture** ?\ *imageName*\ ? ?\ *options* ... ? 

DESCRIPTION
===========

The **picture** is an image type for Tk. It is for full color images
(32-bit pixels) with or without transparency.  Each color component in a
picture is eight bits and there is an 8-bit alpha channel.  Image data for
a picture image can be obtained from a file or a string, or it can be
supplied from C code through a procedural interface.  Many image formats
are supported (JPEG, GIF, TGA, BMP, TIFF, ICO, PDF, PS, etc.) as well as a
number of operations that can be performed on the image such as resizing
(through resampling).

A **picture** image can contain more than one image.  For example, if you
read in a PDF of multiple pages, each page will be an image in the
**picture** object.  The series of images represent a sequence that can be
animated, such as images from an animated GIF.  You can also construct your
own sequence of images.

SYNTAX
======

  **image create picture** ?\ *imageName*\ ? ?\ *options* ... ? 

Creates a new *picture* image.  The name of the new *picture* is returned.
If no *imageName* argument is present, then the name of the picture is
automatically generated in the form ""image0"", ""image1"", etc.

A new TCL command (by the same name as the picture) is also created.
Another TCL command or picture object can not already exist as *imageName*.
If the TCL command is deleted, the picture will also be freed.  Additional
options may be specified on the command line or in the option database to
configure aspects of the widget such as its colors and font.  See the
**configure** operation below for the exact details about what *option* and
*value* pairs are valid.

COLOR SPECIFICATIONS
====================

Pixel color values can be described in any of the following forms:

*colorName*           
  Any of the valid textual names for a color defined in the server's
  color database file, such as "red" or "PeachPuff".

#\ *RGB* #\ *RRGGBB* #\ *RRRGGGBBB* #\ *RRRRGGGGBBBB*
  A numeric specification of the red, green, and blue intensities to use
  to display the color. Each R, G, or B represents a single hexadecimal
  digit.  The four forms permit colors to be specified with 4-bit, 8-bit,
  12-bit or 16-bit values.  When fewer than 16 bits are provided for each
  color, they represent the most significant bits of the color.  For
  example, #3a7 is the same as #3000a0007000.

0x\ *AARRGGBB*                
  A numeric specification of the alpha, red, green, and blue intensities
  to use to display the color. Each A, R, G, or B represents a single
  hexadecimal digit (for example, 0xFFFF0000 is fully opaque red). The
  alpha value represents the transparency of the pixel: "FF" is fully
  opaque, "00" is fully transparent.

PICTURE OPERATIONS
==================

Once you create a picture image, you can use its associated TCL command to
query or modify it.  The general form is

  *imageName* *operation* ?\ *arg* ... ?

Both *operation* and its arguments determine the exact behavior of
the command.  The operations available for pictures are listed below.

*imageName* **add** *pictOrColor*
  Performs an arithmetic-add of each color component of *imageName* with
  the picture or color.  The resulting image is saved in *imageName*.
  *PictOrColor* is either the name of a *picture* image or a color
  specification.  Color components are clamped to 255.
       
  **-invert** *boolean*
     Indicates to invert mask.  This only has affect is the **-mask** switch
     is set.

  **-mask** *mask*
    Only change the non-zero pixels of *mask* in *imageName*.
    *Mask* is either the name of a *picture* image. 

*imageName* **and** *pictOrColor* 
  Performs a bitwise-and on each color component of *imageName* with the
  picture or color. *PictOrColor* is either the name of a *picture* image
  or a color specification.  The resulting image is saved in *imageName*.
  
  **-invert** *boolean*
     Indicates to invert mask.  This only has affect is the **-mask** switch
     is set.

  **-mask** *mask*
    Only change the non-zero pixels of *mask* in *imageName*.
    *Mask* is either the name of a *picture* image. 

*imageName* **blank** ?\ *colorSpec*\ ?
  Blanks the image filling it with *colorSpec*.  This sets the initial
  layer of the picture.  *ColorSpec* is a color name or pixel hex value.
  If no *colorSpec* argument is present, the color defaults to "white".

*imageName* **blur** *srcName* *numPixels* 
  Blurs *srcName* performing a boxcar blur using *numPixels* as the radius
  of the blur.  The resulting image is saved in *imageName*.  *SrcName* is
  the name of a *picture* image and can be the same as *imageName*.
  *NumPixels* is a positive number indicating the width of the blur.

*imageName* **cget** *option* 
  Returns the current value of the configuration option given by
  *option*.  *Option* may have any of the values accepted by the
  **configure** operation.

*imageName* **colorblend** *bgImage* *fgImage* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Blends *fgImage* into the *bgImage* using one the **Photoshop** blending
  modes. *BgImage* and *fgImage* must be *picture* images, and one of them
  may be the same as *imageName*.  The following switches are available.

  **-mode** *mode*
    Specifies the blend mode to use. The default is "normal".  *Mode* can
    be one of the following:

    **colorburn**
      Selects the color component and darkens the *bgImage* color to reflect
      the *fgImage* color by increasing the contrast between the two. 
    
    **colordodge**
      Selects the color component and brightens the *bgImage* color to
      reflect the *fgColor* color by decreasing contrast. Blending with
      black produces no change.

    **darken**
      Selects the darker color components between *bgImage* and *fgImage*.
      Pixels lighter than the *fgImage* color are replaced, and pixels
      darker than the *fgImage* color do not change.
    
    **difference**
      Subtracts the color components; either the *fgImage* color from the
      *bgImage* color or the *bgImage* color from the *fgImage* color,
      depending on which has the greater brightness value. Blending with
      white inverts the *bgImage* color values; blending with black
      produces no change.

    **exclusion**
      Creates an effect similar to but lower in contrast than the
      **difference** mode. Blending with white inverts the base color
      values. Blending with black produces no change.

    **hardlight**
      Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the *fgImage*
      color. The effect is similar to shining a harsh spotlight on the
      image. If the *fgImage* color (light source) is lighter than 50%
      gray, the image is lightened, as if it were screened. This is useful
      for adding highlights to an image. If the *bgImage* color is darker
      than 50% gray, the image is darkened, as if it were multiplied. This
      is useful for adding shadows to an image. Painting with pure black or
      white results in pure black or white.

    **hardmix**
      Adds the color components of the *fgImage* color to the RGB values of
      the *bgImage* color. If the resulting sum for a channel is 255 or
      greater, it receives a value of 255; if less than 255, a value
      of 0. Therefore, all blended pixels have red, green, and blue channel
      values of either 0 or 255. This changes all pixels to primary
      additive colors (red, green, or blue), white, or black.

    **lighten**
      Selects the lighter color components between *bgImage* and *fgImage*.
      Pixels darker than the *fgImage* color are replaced, and pixels
      lighter than the *fgImage* color do not change.
    
    **linearburn**
      Darkens the *bgImage* color to reflect the *fgImage* color by decreasing
      the brightness.  Blending with white produces no change.
    
    **lineardodge**
      Lightens the *bgImage* color to reflect the *fgImage* color by
      increasing the brightness.  Blending with black produces no change.

    **linearlight**
      Burns or dodges the colors by decreasing or increasing the
      brightness, depending on the *fgImage* color. If the *fgImage* color
      (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, the image is lightened by
      increasing the brightness. If the *fgImage* color is darker than 50%
      gray, the image is darkened by decreasing the brightness.

    **multiply**
      Multiplies each color component in *bgImage* with *fgImage*. The
      resulting color is always a darker color. Pixels lighter than the
      *fgImage* color are replaced, and pixels darker than the *fgImage*
      color do not change.
    
    **normal**
      Copies *fgImage* into *bgImage*.  The resulting color is always
      the same as *fgImage*.
      
    **overlay**
      Multiplies or screens the colors, depending on the *bgImage*
      color. Patterns or colors overlay the existing pixels while
      preserving the highlights and shadows of the *bgImage* color. The
      *bgImage* color is not replaced, but mixed with the *fgImage* color
      to reflect the lightness or darkness of the original color.

    **pinlight**
      Replaces the colors, depending on the *fgImage* color. If the
      *fgImage* color (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, pixels
      darker than the *fgImage* color are replaced, and pixels lighter than
      the *fgImage* color do not change. If the *fgImage* color is darker
      than 50% gray, pixels lighter than the *fgImage* color are replaced,
      and pixels darker than the *fgImage* color do not change. This is
      useful for adding special effects to an image.

    **screen**
      Multiplies the inverse of each color component of *bgImage* and
      *fgImage*.  The resulting color is always a lighter color. Screening
      with black leaves the color unchanged. Screening with white produces
      white.  The effect is similar to projecting multiple photographic
      slides on top of each other.

    **softlight**
      Darkens or lightens the colors, depending on the *fgImage* color. The
      effect is similar to shining a diffused spotlight on the image. If
      the *fgImage* color (light source) is lighter than 50% gray, the
      image is lightened as if it were dodged. If the *fgImage* color is
      darker than 50% gray, the image is darkened as if it were burned
      in. Painting with pure black or white produces a distinctly darker or
      lighter area, but does not result in pure black or white.
    
    **subtract**
      Subtracts the *fgImage* color from the *bgImage* color.  Any
      resulting negative values are clipped to zero.
    
    **vividlight**
      Burns or dodges the colors by increasing or decreasing the contrast,
      depending on the *fgImage* color. If the *fgImage* color (light
      source) is lighter than 50% gray, the image is lightened by
      decreasing the contrast. If the *fgImage* color is darker than 50%
      gray, the image is darkened by increasing the contrast.

  **-from** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *srcName* image to be copied. *Bbox* is
    a list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or "*x1*
    *y1*".  The first describes the subregion to be copied.  The second
    says to copy the subimage starting at *x1*,\ *y1* of the
    foreground image and copying region extending to the lower right corner
    of *fgImage*.

  **-to** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *bgImage* image to be
    blended. *Bbox* is a list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2*
    *y2*" or "*x1* *y1*".  The first describes the subregion to
    be blended.  The second says to copy the subimage starting at
    *x1*,\ *y1* of the background image and copying region extending
    to the lower right corner of *bgImage*.

*imageName* **composite** *bgName* *fgName*  ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Composites *fgImage* over *bgImage* using one the alpha channels of both
  images.  If *fgImage* is opaque, then this is same as copying *fgName*.
  If *fgName* and *bgName* are different sizes, only the overlapping pixels
  are blended. The resulting image is saved in *imageName*.  *BgImage* and
  *fgImage* must be *picture* images, and one of them may be the same as
  *imageName*.  The following switches are available.

  **-from** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *bgName* image to be blended. *Bbox* is a
    list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or "*x1* *y1*".  The first form
    describes the subregion to be blended.  The second indicates to copy
    the subimage starting at *x1*,\ *y1* of *bgName* extending
    to the lower right corner.

  **-to** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *fgName* image to be blended. *Bbox* is a
    list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or "*x1* *y1*".  The first form
    describes the subregion to be blended.  The second indicates to copy
    the subimage starting at *x1*,\ *y1* of *fgName* and extending to the
    lower right corner.

*imageName* **configure** ?\ *option* *value* ... ?
  Query or modify the configuration options for the image.  If no
  *option* is specified, returns a list describing all of the available
  options for *imageName* (see **Tk_ConfigureInfo** for information
  on the format of this list).  If *option* is specified with no
  *value*, then the command returns a list describing the one named
  option (this list will be identical to the corresponding sublist of the
  value returned if no *option* is specified).  If one or more
  *option-value* pairs are specified, then the command modifies the
  given option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case the command
  returns an empty string.  The valid option-value pairs are described
  below.

  **-autoscale** *boolean*
    When the dimensions of the image change, automatically resize the
    image to match the new dimensions.  The **-filter** and **-maxpect**
    also control how the image is resized.

  **-data** *string*
    Specifies the contents of the image as a string.  The string should
    contain binary data or base64-encoded data.  The format of the string
    must be one of those for which there is an image file format handler
    that will accept string data.  It is an error if both the **-data** and
    **-file** options are specified.

  **-dither** *boolean*
    Indicates to dither the picture.  Dithering scatters different colored
    pixels in an image to make it appear as though there are intermediate
    colors in images with a limited color palette. Dithering propagates
    quantization errors from one pixel to its neighbors.

    Reference: Victor Ostromoukhov, "A Simple and Efficient Error-Diffusion
    Algorithm" in SIGGRAPH'01.

  **-file** *fileName*
    *FileName* gives the name of a file that is to be read to supply
    data for the picture image.  The file format must be one of those for
    which there is an image file format handler that can read data.

  **-filter** *filterName*
    Specifies the use *filterName* when resizing the image.  This option
    matters only when **-autoscale** is on. The valid filter names are
    specified in the **resample** operation below.

  **-gamma** *number*
    Specifies that the colors allocated for displaying this image in a
    window should be corrected for a non-linear display with the specified
    gamma exponent value.  (The intensity produced by most CRT displays is
    a power function of the input value, to a good approximation; gamma is
    the exponent and is typically around 2).  The value specified must be
    greater than zero.  The default value is one (no correction).  In
    general, values greater than one will make the image lighter, and
    values less than one will make it darker.

  **-height** *numPixels*
    Specifies the height of the image, in pixels.  *NumPixels* may have any
    of the forms acceptable to **Tk_GetPixels**, such as "200" or
    "2.4i". This option let you specify an image a particular size and then
    draw into it. If *numPixels* is 0, the image will expand or shrink
    vertically to fit the data stored in it.  The default is 0.

  **-maxpect** *boolean*
    When resizing the image, maintain the aspect ratio of the original
    picture.

  **-rotate** *numDegrees*
    Rotates the image by *numDegrees*. *NumDegrees* is the number of degrees
    to rotate the image.

  **-sharpen** *boolean*
    Automatically sharpens the image.

  **-width** *numPixels*
    Specifies the width of the image in pixels.  *NumPixels* may have any
    of the forms acceptable to **Tk_GetPixels**, such as "200" or
    "2.4i". If *numPixels* is 0, the width of the image will be adjusted to
    fit the data stored in it.  The default is 0.

  **-window** *windowName*
    Specifies a window to be snapped. The screen contents of *windowName*
    are captured in the picture image.  The format *windowName* is either a
    Tk window name or a hexadecimal number (e.g. "0x000000002100") if the
    window is an external window.  *WindowName* can must be fully visible.
    It can not be partially off-screen or covered by another window.
    You should raise the window before using this option.

*imageName* **copy** *srcName* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Copies a region from the image called *srcName* (which must be a picture
  image) to the image called *imageName*.  If no options are specified,
  this command copies the whole of *srcName* into *imageName*, starting at
  coordinates (0,0) in *imageName*.  *ImageName* is not resized.  If *srcName*
  is bigger than *imageName* then only the pixels that overlap are copied.
  *Switches* may be any of the following.

  **-blend** *bool*
    The contents of the *srcName* are blended with the background or
    *imageName*.  The is only useful when *srcName* contains
    transparent pixels.

  **-from** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *srcName* image to be copied. *Bbox* is a
    list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or "*x1* *y1*".  The first form
    describes the subregion to be copied.  The second indicates to copy the
    subimage starting at *x1*,\ *y1* of the source image and copying region
    extending to the lower right corner of *srcName*.

  **-to** *bbox*
    Specifies the region in the *imageName* image to be copied. *Bbox* is a
    list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or "*x1* *y1*".  The first form
    describes the subregion to be copied.  The second indicates to copy the
    subimage starting at *x1*,\ *y1* of the destination image and copying
    region extending to the lower right corner of *imageName*.


*imageName* **crop** *x1*  *y1* ?\ *x2*  *y2*\ ?
  Crops *imageName* to specified rectangular region.  The region is defined
  by the coordinates *x1*, *y1*, *x2*, *y2* (where *x1*, *y1* and *x2*,
  *y2* describe opposite corners of a crop rectangle).  *ImageName* will be
  resized to the new size.  

  All coordinates are interior to the crop rectangle.  So if *x1* is 0 and
  *x2* is 10 the width of the image is 11 pixels. Coordinates outside the
  image will be clamped.  For example if *x2* is "10000" and the image
  width is 50, it will be clamped to 49.

  If no *x2* and *y2* coordinates are specified, then the region is from
  the point *x1*, *y1* to the lower right corner of *imageName*.

*imageName* **crossfade** *fromImage* *toImage* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Cross fades *toImage* into *fromImage*, saving the result in
  *imageName*. *FromImage* and *toImage* can be either the name of a
  picture (it can not be *imageName*) or a color specification.  For
  example if *toImage* is "black", this image will fade to black.
  *FromImage* and *toImage* cannot both be colors. *ImageName* will first
  be a copy of *fromImage*.  It is progressively changed by fading the
  *fromImage* and adding *toImage* until *imageName* is a copy of
  *toImage*.

  If **-delay** is greater than zero, the transition automatically starts
  after this command completes at an idle point. Care must be taken not to
  the change *imageName* while the transition is occurring. The results
  will be unexpected. You can specify a TCL variable that is automatically
  set when the transition has completed. See the **-variable** switch.
  The rate of transition is determined by both the **-delay** and
  **-steps** switches.  *Switches* may be any of the following.

  **-goto** *step*
    Specifies the current step of the transition.  The default is 1.

  **-delay** *milliseconds*
    Specifies the delay between steps in the transition in milliseconds.
    If *milliseconds* is 0, then no automatic changes will occur.
    The default is "0".

  **-steps** *numSteps*
    Specifies how may steps the transition should take.  The default is
    "10".

  **-variable** *varName*
    Specifies the name of a TCL variable that will be set when the
    transition has completed.

*imageName* **dissolve** *fromImage* *toImage* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Transitions from *fromImage* to *toImage* by dissolving *toImage*
  into *fromImage* and saving the result in *imageName*. *FromImage* and
  *toImage* can be either the name of a picture (it can not be
  *imageName*) or a color specification.  *FromImage* and *toImage* cannot
  both be colors. *ImageName* starts as a copy of *fromImage*.  It is
  progressively changed by randomly copying pixels from *toImage* into it.

  Reference: "A Digital "Dissolve" Effect" by Mike Morton in "Graphics
  Gems V", pp. 221-232, Academic Press, 1994.

  This transition will start after this command completes, when an idle
  point is reached. Care must be taken not to change *imageName* while the
  transition is occurring. The results may be unexpected. You can specify a
  TCL variable that will be automatically set when the transition has
  completed. See the **-variable** switch.  The rate of transition is
  determined by both the **-delay** and **-steps** switches.
  *Switches* may be any of the following.

  **-delay** *milliseconds*
    Specifies the delay between steps in the transition in milliseconds.
    The default is "0". 

  **-steps** *numSteps*
    Specifies how may steps the transition should take.  The default is
    "10".
     
  **-variable** *varName*
    Specifies the name of a TCL variable that will be set when the
    transition has completed.

*imageName* **draw** ?\ *args* ... ?

*imageName* **dup** ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Returns the name of a new picture image that is a duplicate of
  *imageName*. The following switches are available.

  **-region** *bbox*
    Instead of duplicating all of *imageName*, this specifies a sub-region
    to be duplicated. *Bbox* is a list in the form "*x1* *y1* *x2* *y2*" or
    "*x1* *y1*".  The first form describes two opposite corners of the
    sub-region to be copied.  The second form is where *x1*,\ *y1* is the
    upper left corner of the sub-region and the lower right corner of
    *imageName* is the other corner.

*imageName* **emboss** *srcName*
  Embosses *srcName* and saves the result in *imageName*.  *SrcName* is the
  name of picture image, but can't the same as *imageName*.  The image
  is embossed by shading the RGB pixels using a single distant light source.

  Reference: "Fast Embossing Effects on Raster Image Data" by John Schlag,
  in "Graphics Gems IV", Academic Press, 1994.
  
*imageName* **export** *imageFormat* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Exports *imageName* into another format. *ImageFormat* is one of the
  different formats are described in the section `PICTURE FORMATS`_
  below. *Switches* are specific to *imageFormat*.

*imageName* **fade** *srcName* *percent*
  Decreases the opacity of *srcName* by *percent* (making it more
  transparent) and saves the result in *imageName*.  *Percent* is
  percentage (0 to 100) that specifies the amount to reduce the opacity.
  *SrcName* is the name of picture image and can the same as *imageName*.
  
*imageName* **flip x** ?\ *srcName*\ ?
  Flips the image in *srcName* horizontally and saves the result in
  *imageName*.  If no *srcName* argument is given, then *imageName*
  is flipped.

*imageName* **flip y** ?\ *srcName*\ ?
  Flips the image in *srcName* vertically and saves the result in
  *imageName*.  If no *srcName* argument is given, then *imageName*
  is flipped.

*imageName* **gamma** *gammaValue* 
  Gamma corrects *imageName* using *gammaValue*.  Specifies that the colors
  allocated for displaying this image in a window should be corrected for a
  non-linear display with the specified gamma exponent value.  (The
  intensity produced by most CRT displays is a power function of the input
  value, to a good approximation; gamma is the exponent and is typically
  around 2).  The value specified must be greater than zero.  The default
  value is "1.0" (no correction).  In general, values greater than one will
  make the image lighter, and values less than one will make it darker.

  *GammaValue* is used to compute the light intensity of the monitor as

     L = pow(v, gammaValue);

  where L is the radiance (light intensity) and v is the voltage applied.

*imageName* **get** *x* *y* 
  Returns the pixel value at the designated coordinates in *imageName*. The
  pixel at *x*,\ *y* must reside within the image.  The upper left corner
  of the image is 0,0.  The lower right corner is width-1, height-1.
  
*imageName* **greyscale** *srcName*
  Converts *srcName* to greyscale and saves the result in *imageName*
  *SrcName* is the name of picture image. It can be the same as
  *imageName*.

  Luminosity is computed using the formula

    Y = 0.212671 * R + 0.715160 * G + 0.072169 * B

  where Y is the luminosity and R, G, and B are color components.

      sharpening the image. The support is 2.0.

    **gaussian**
      The gauss filter uses a sloped curve, weighting the sampling gently
      at the top of the peak and toward the edge of the sampled area. This
      filtering method is often used to control the soft staircase artifact
      effect.  The support is 1.25.

    **lanczos3**

PICTURE FORMATS
===============

Pictures can import and export their data into various formats.
They are loaded using the TCL **package** mechanism. Normally this
is done automatically for you when you invoke an **import** or
**export** operation on a picture.

The available formats are **bmp**, **gif**, **ico**, **jpg**, **pdf**,
**photo**, **png**, **pbm**, **ps**, **tga**, **tif**, **xbm**, and **xpm**
and are described below.

**bmp**
~~~~~~~

The *bmp* module reads and writes Device Independent Bitmap (BMP) data.
The BMP format supports 8, 15, 16, 24, and 32 bit pixels.
The 32-bit format supports 8-bit RGB components with an 8-bit alpha
channel.  The package can be manually loaded as follows.


    **package require blt_picture_bmp**

By default this package is automatically loaded when you use the *bmp*
format in the **import** or **export** operations.

*imageName* **import bmp** ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Imports BMP data into *imageName*.  Either the **-file** or **-data**
  switch (described below) is required. The following import switches are
  supported:

  **-data** *string*
   Read the BMP information from *string*.

  **-file** *fileName*
   Read the BMP file from *fileName*.

*imageName* **export bmp** ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Exports *imageName* into BMP data.  If no **-file** or **-data** switch
  is provided, this command returns the BMP output as a base64 string.  If
  *imageName* is greyscale, then the BMP output will be one 8-bit component
  per pixel, otherwise it will contain three 8-bit components per pixel.  If
  any pixel in *imageName* is not opaque, then an extra alpha component is
  output.

  The following switches are supported:

  **-alpha**
    Indicates to create BMP data with an 8-bit alpha channel.  This
    option affects only non-opaque pixels in *imageName*.  By default
    non-opaque pixels are blended with a background color (see the
    **-background** option).

  **-background** *colorSpec*
    Specifies the color of the background.  This is used if *imageName*
    contains non-opaque pixels and the **-alpha** switch is not set.
    *ColorSpec* is a color specification. The default background color
    is "white".

  **-data** *varName*
    Specifies the name of TCL variable to be set with the binary BMP
    data. *VarName* is the name of a global TCL variable.  It will
    contain a byte array object.

  **-file** *fileName*
    Write the BMP output to the file *fileName*.

  **-index** *pictIndex*
    Specifies the picture in the sequence of pictures of *imageName* to be
    exported. *PictIndex* is a non-negative number.  The default is 0,
    which is the first picture.

**gif**
~~~~~~~~

The *gif* module reads and writes Graphic Interchange Format (GIF) data.
The package can be manually loaded as follows.

    **package require blt_picture_gif**

By default this package is automatically loaded when you use the *gif*
format in the **import** or **export** operations.

*imageName* **import gif** ?\ *switches* ... ?

   Read the GIF information from *string*.

  **-file** *fileName*
   Read the GIF file from *fileName*.

*imageName* **export gif** ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Exports *imageName* into GIF data.  If no **-file** or **-data** switch
  is provided, this command returns the GIF output as a base64 string.
  The following switches are supported:

  **-animate** 
   Generates animated GIF output using the list of pictures in
   *imageName*. All the pictures in *imageName* should be the same size.

  **-background** *colorSpec*
    Specifies the color of the background.  This is used if *imageName*
    contains semi-transparent pixels.  *ColorSpec* is a color specification.

    exported. *PictIndex* is a non-negative number.  The default is 0,
    which is the first picture.

**ico**
~~~~~~~

The *ico* module reads and writes the image file format for computer icons
in Microsoft Windows (ICO). ICO files contain one or more small images at
multiple sizes and color depths, such that they may be scaled
appropriately. The package can be manually loaded as follows.

    **package require blt_picture_ico**

By default this package is automatically loaded when you use the *ico*
