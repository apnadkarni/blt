SYNOPSIS
--------

**blt::combomenu** *pathName* ?\ *option value* ... ?

DESCRIPTION
-----------

The **blt::combomenu** command creates and manages *combomenu* widgets.  A
*combomenu* widget contains a menu and optional embedded Tk scrollbar
widgets (vertical and/or horizontal).  The scrollbars are automatically
exposed or hidden as necessary when the *combomenu* widget is resized.
Whenever the *combomenu* window is smaller horizontally and/or vertically
than the actual menu, the appropiate scrollbar is exposed.

When mapped, the *combomenu* displays a menu items.  There exist several
different types of items, each with different actions and attributes.
Items of different types may be combined in a single menu.  Menu items are
not distinct widgets; the entire *combomenu* is one widget.

SYNTAX
------

The **blt::combomenu** command creates a new window using the *pathName*
argument and makes it into a *combomenu* widget.  The command has the
following form.

  **blt::combomenu** *pathName* ?\ *option value* ... ?

Additional options may be specified on the command line or in the option
database to configure aspects of the combomenu such as its background color
or scrollbars. The **blt::combomenu** command returns its *pathName*
argument.  There must not already exist a window named *pathName*, but
*pathName*'s parent must exist.

The normal size of the *combomenu* is the computed size to display all menu
items. You can specify the maximum and minimum width and height of the
*combomenu* window using the **-width** and **-height** widget options.
Scrollbars are specified for *combomenu* by the **-xscrollbar** and
**-yscrollbar** widget options.  The scrollbars must be children of the
*pathName*.  The scrollbars may be specified before they exist.  If the
specified width or height is less than the computed size of the combomenu,
the appropiate scrollbar is automatically displayed.

MENU ITEMS
----------

A menu is a widget that displays a collection of item arranged in one or
more columns.  There exist several different types of items (specified by
the item's **-type** option), each with different properties.  Items of
different types may be combined in a single menu.  Menu items are not
distinct widgets; the entire *combomenu* is one widget.

A menu item can be one of the following types: 

**button**
  The *button* is the most common type of menu item that behaves much
  like a Tk **button** widget.  When it isinvoked, a TCL command is
  executed.  The TCL command is specified with the **-command** option.

**cascade**
  A *cascade* item has an associated *combomenu* (specified by the item's
  **-menu** option) that is posted to the right of the *cascade* item
  when the item is active.  The **postcascade** operation also posts the
  associated *combomenu*. *Cascade* items allow the construction of
  cascading menus.  The associated menu must be a child of the
  *combomenu* containing the *cascade* item.

**checkbutton**
  A *checkbutton* menu item behaves much like a Tk **checkbutton** widget.
  When it is invoked it toggles back and forth between the selected and
  deselected states.  When the item is selected, a particular value is
  stored in a particular global variable (as determined by the
  **-onvalue** and **-variable** options for the item); when the item is
  deselected another value (determined by the **-offvalue** option) is
  stored in the global variable.  An indicator box is displayed to the
  left of the label.  When the item is selected, a check is displayed in
  the indicator. If a **-command** option is specified, its value is
  evaluated as a TCL command each time the item is invoked; this happens
  after toggling the item's selected state.

**radiobutton**
  A *radiobutton* menu item behaves much like a Tk **radiobutton** widget.
  *Radiobutton* items are organized in groups of which only one item may be
  selected at a time.  Whenever a particular item becomes selected it
  stores a particular value into a particular global variable (as
  determined by the **-value** and **-variable** options for the item).
  This action causes any previously selected item in the same group to
  deselect itself.  Once an item has become selected, any change to the
  item's associated variable will cause the item to deselect itself.
  Grouping of *radiobutton* items is determined by their associated
  variables: if two items have the same associated variable then they are
  in the same group.  An indicator circle is displayed to the left of the
  label.  If the item is selected then the indicator's center is filled
  with a solid color.  If a **-command** option is specified then its value
  is evaluated as a TCL command when the item is invoked; this happens
  after selecting the item.

**separator**
  A *separator* item displays a horizontal dividing line.  A *separator*
  can't be activated or invoked, and it has no behavior other than its
  display appearance.

Menu items are displayed with up to four separate fields.

*label*
  The main field is a label in the form of a text string, or an image,
  controlled by the **-text** and **-image** options for the item.

*icon*
  If the **-icon** option is specified, then a image is displayed to the
  left of the label.

*accelerator*
  If the **-accelerator** option is specified for an item then a second
  textual field is displayed to the right of the label.  The accelerator
  typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be typed in the
  application to cause the same result as invoking the menu entry.

*indicator*
  The indicator is present only for *checkbutton*, *radiobutton*, and
  *cascade* entries.  For *checkbutton* and *radiobutton* items it
  indicates whether the item is selected or not, and is displayed to the
  left of the entry's string.  For *cascade* items it indicates that
  clicking on item will post yet another menu and is displayed to the right
  of the accelerator.

REFERENCING MENU ITEMS
----------------------

Menu items may be referred to by either their index, label, or tag.

*index*
  The number of the menu item.  Indices start from 0.  The index of an
  item as other items are added, deleted, moved, or sorted. There are
  also the following special non-numeric indices.

  **active**
    The item that that is currently active.  Typically this is the
    item that the pointer is currently over.

  **end**
    The last item in the menu. 
    
  **first**
    The first item in the menu. Disable and hidden items are ignored.

  **last**
    The last item in the menu. Disable and hidden items are ignored.

  **next**
    The next item from the currently active item.
    
  **previous**
    The previous item from the currently active item.

  **selected**
    The last selected menu item.   
    
  **view.bottom**
    The last visible item in the menu.  This changes are the the
    menu is scrolled.
    
  **view.top**
    The first visible item in the menu.  This changes are the the
    menu is scrolled.

*label*
  The label of the item (specified by the **-text** menu item option).
  Labels should not be numbers (to distinguish them from indices) or tags.

*tag*
  A tag is a string associated with an item.  They are a useful for
  referring to groups of items. Items can have any number of tags
  associated with them (specified by the **-tags** menu item option).  A
  tag may refer to multiple items.  There are two built-in tags: "all" and
  "end".  Every item has the tag "all".  The last item in the menu will
  have the tag "end".
     
If an item is specified by an integer it is assumed to be an index.  If it
is specified by a string, it is first tested if it's a valid label and then
a tag.  This means that you shouldn't have tags and labels that are the
same.  They will always be interpreted as labels.  Unlike labels, tags
aren't seen by the user, so you can do whatever you want to make them
unique (example: "mytag::fred").

If an item's **-command** option is specified, a TCL command will be invoke
whenever the item is selected (typically by clicking on the item).
  
OPERATIONS
----------

All *combomenu* operations are invoked by specifying the widget's
pathname, the operation, and any arguments that pertain to that
operation.  The general form is:

  *pathName operation* ?\ *arg arg ...*\ ?

*Operation* and the *arg*\ s determine the exact behavior of the
command.  The following operations are available for *combomenu* widgets:

*pathName* **activate** *itemName* 
  Redisplays *itemName* using its active colors and relief.  This typically
  is used by widget bindings to highlight menu items when the pointer is
  moved over items in the menu. Any previously active item is deactivated.
  *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than
  one menu item.

*pathName* **add** ?\ *option* *value* ...?  Creates a new menu item,
  adding it to the end of the menu.  If one or more *option-value* pairs
  are specified, they modify the given menu item option(s) to have the
  given value(s).  *Option* and *value* are described in the **item
  configure** operation.

*pathName* **bbox** *itemName* 
  Returns of list of four numbers describing the bounding box of
  *itemName*.  The numbers represent the x and y root coordinates of two
  opposite corners of the box. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag,
  but may not represent more than one menu item.

*pathName* **cget** *option*  
  Returns the current value of the widget configuration option given by
  *option*. *Option* may have any of the values accepted by the
  **configure** operation. They are described in the **configure**
  operation below.

*pathName* **configure** ?\ *option*\ ? ?\ *value*? ?\ *option value ...*\ ?
  Queries or modifies the configuration options of the widget.  If no
  *option* is specified, this command returns a list describing all the
  available options for *pathName* (see **Tk_ConfigureInfo** for
  information on the format of this list).  If *option* is specified with
  no *value*, then a list describing the one named option (this list will
  be identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
  *option* is specified) is returned.  If one or more *option-value* pairs
  are specified, then this command modifies the given widget option(s) to
  have the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty
  string.  *Option* and *value* are described below.

  Widget configuration options may be set either by the **configure**
  operation or the Tk **option** command.  The resource class is
  **BltCombomenu**.  The resource name is the name of the widget::

    forms accept able to **Tk_GetPixels**, such as "200" or "2.4i".  If
    *numPixels* is a 2 element list, then this sets the minimum and maximum
    limits for the height of the menu. The menu will be at least the
    minimum height and less than or equal to the maximum. If *numPixels* is
    a 3 element list, then this specifies minimum, maximum, and nominal
    height or the menu.  The nominal size overrides the calculated height
    of the menu.  If *numPixels* is "", then the height of the menu is
    calculated based on all the menu items.  The default is "".

  **-iconvariable** *varName* 
    Specifies the name of a global TCL variable that will be set to the

    a non-negative value indicating the width and height of the radiobutton
    circle. The value may have any of the forms acceptable to
    *Tk_GetPixels*, such as "1.2i".  The default is "12".

  **-relief** *reliefName* 
    Specifies the 3-D effect for the menu.  *ReliefName* indicates how the
    menu should appear relative to the root window. Acceptable values are
    **raised**, **sunken**, **flat**, **ridge**, **solid**, and

      the parent widget width.

    **both**
      The menu width will the same as the parent widget width.

    **none**
      Don't restrict the menu width. This is the default.
       
  **-takefocus** *boolean*
    Provides information used when moving the focus from window to window
    via keyboard traversal (e.g., Tab and Shift-Tab).  If *boolean* is "0",
    this means that this window should be skipped entirely during keyboard
    traversal.  "1" means that the this window should always receive the
    input focus.  An empty value means that the traversal scripts make the
    decision whether to focus on the window.  The default is "".

  **-textvariable** *varName* 
    Specifies the name of a global TCL variable that contains the label of
    the selected item.  *VarName* is the name of a TCL variable. When an

    no variable is set. The default is "".

  **-width** *numPixels*
    Specifies the width in the *combomenu*.  *NumPixels* can be single
    value or a list.  If *numPixels* is a single value it is a non-negative
    value indicating the width the menu. The value may have any of the
    forms accept able to **Tk_GetPixels**, such as "200" or "2.4i".  If
    *numPixels* is a 2 element list, then this sets the minimum and maximum
    limits for the width of the menu. The menu will be at least the minimum
    width and less than or equal to the maximum. If *numPixels* is a 3
    element list, then this specifies minimum, maximum, and nominal width
    or the menu.  The nominal size overrides the calculated width of the
    menu.  If *numPixels* is "", then the width of the menu is calculated
    based on the widths of all the menu items.  The default is "".

  **-xscrollbar** *widgetName*
    Specifies the name of a scrollbar widget to use as the horizontal
    scrollbar for this menu.  The scrollbar widget must be a child of the
    combomenu and doesn't have to exist yet.  At an idle point later, the
    combomenu will attach the scrollbar to widget, effectively packing the
    scrollbar into the menu.

  **-xscrollcommand** *cmdPrefix*
    Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with horizontal
    scrollbars.  Whenever the horizontal view in the widget's window
    changes, the widget will generate a TCL command by concatenating the
    scroll command and two numbers. If this option is not specified, then
    no command will be executed.  The widget's initialization script
    will automatically set this for you.

  **-xscrollincrement** *numPixels*
    Sets the horizontal scrolling unit. This is the distance the menu is
    scrolled horizontally by one unit. *NumPixels* is a non-negative value
    indicating the width of the 3-D border drawn around the menu. The
    value may have any of the forms accept able to **Tk_GetPixels**.  The
    default is "20".

  **-yscrollbar** *widgetName*
    Specifies the name of a scrollbar widget to use as the vertical
    scrollbar for this menu.  The scrollbar widget must be a child of the
    combomenu and doesn't have to exist yet.  At an idle point later, the
    combomenu will attach the scrollbar to widget, effectively packing the
    scrollbar into the menu.

  **-yscrollcommand** *cmdPrefix*
    Specifies the prefix for a command used to communicate with vertical
    scrollbars.  Whenever the vertical view in the widget's window
    changes, the widget will generate a TCL command by concatenating the
    scroll command and two numbers.  If this option is not specified, then
    no command will be executed.  The widget's initialization script
    will automatically set this for you.

  **-yscrollincrement** *numPixels*
    Sets the vertical scrolling unit.  This is the distance the menu is
    scrolled vertically by one unit. *NumPixels* is a non-negative value
    indicating the width of the 3-D border drawn around the menu. The
    value may have any of the forms accept able to **Tk_GetPixels**.  The
    default is "20".

*pathName* **deactivate** 
  Redisplays all menu items using their normal colors.  This typically is
  used by widget bindings to un-highlight menu items as the pointer is
  moved over the menu. 

*pathName* **delete** *itemName*\ ...
  Deletes one or more items from the menu. *ItemName* may be a label,
  index, or tag and may refer to multiple items (example: "all").

*pathName* **deselect** *itemName*
  Deselects *itemName* and sets the associated variables to their off values.
  *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one
  menu item.  If this item was not currently selected, the command has no
  effect.

*pathName* **exists** *itemName*
  Returns the *itemName* exists in the menu. *ItemName* may be a label,
  index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu item.  Returns
  "1" is the item exists, "0" otherwise.
  
*pathName* **find** *string* ?\ *switches* ... ?
  Searches for the next menu item that matches *string*.  Returns the
  index of the matching item or "-1" if no match is found.  *Switches* can
  be one of the following:

  **-decreasing** 
    Search menu items in order of the highest to lowest index.

  **-from** *itemName* 
    Specifies the menu item frow where to start searching.  *ItemName* may
    be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu
    item.

  **-glob** 
    Indicates that *string* is **glob**\-style pattern.  Matching is done in a
    fashion similar to that used by the TCL **glob** command.

  **-regexp** 
    Indicates that *string* is regular expression.  Matching is done in a
    fashion similar to that used by the TCL *regexp* command.

  **-type** *itemType*
    Specifies the type of menu items to search.  *ItemType* may be
    and of the types described in the **-type** option. 

  **-underline** 
    Specifies to match the items underlined character instead of its
    entire label.

*pathName* **index** *itemName* 
  Returns the index of *itemName*. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or
  tag, but may not represent more than one menu item.  If the item does not
  exist, "-1" is returned.
  
*pathName* **insert after** *itemName* ?\ *option *value* ... ? 
  Creates a new menu item and inserts it after *itemName*.  Normally menu
  items are appended to the end of the menu, but this command allows you to
  specify its location. Note that this may change the indices of previously
  created menu items. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not
  represent more than one menu item. If one or more *option-value* pairs
  are specified, they modifies the given menu item option(s) to have the
  given value(s).  *Option* and *value* are described in the **item
  configure** operation.
  
*pathName* **insert at** *itemName* ?\ *option *value* ... ? 
  Creates a new menu item and inserts it at the index specified by
  *itemName*.  Normally menu items are appended to the end of the menu, but
  this command allows you to specify its location. Note that this may
  change the indices of previously created menu items. *ItemName* may be a
  label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu item. If
  one or more *option-value* pairs are specified, they modifies the given
  menu item option(s) to have the given value(s).  *Option* and *value* are
  described in the **item configure** operation.
  
*pathName* **insert before** *itemName* ?\ *option *value* ... ? 
  Creates a new menu item and inserts it before *itemName*.  Normally menu
  items are appended to the end of the menu, but this command allows you to
  specify its location. Note that this may change the indices of previously
  created menu items. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not
  represent more than one menu item. If one or more *option-value* pairs
  are specified, they modifies the given menu item option(s) to have the
  given value(s).  *Option* and *value* are described in the **item
  configure** operation.
  
*pathName* **invoke** *itemName* 
  Selects the *item and invokes the TCL command specified by *itemName*'s
  **-command** option. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may
  not represent more than one menu item.
  
*pathName* **item cget** *itemName* *option*
  Returns the current value of the configuration option for *itemName*
  given by *option*.  *Option* may be any option described below for the
  **item configure** operation below. *ItemName* may be a label, index, or
  tag, but may not represent more than one menu item.

*pathName* **item configure** *itemName* ?\ *option* *value* ... ?
  Queries or modifies the configuration options of *itemName*.  *ItemName*
  may be a label, index, or tag.  If no *option* is specified, returns a
  list describing all the available options for *itemName* (see
  **Tk_ConfigureInfo** for information on the format of this list).  If
  *option* is specified with no *value*, then the command returns a list
  describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
  corresponding sublist of the value returned if no *option* is specified).
  In both cases, *itemName* may not represent more than one menu item.
  
  If one or more *option-value* pairs are specified, then this command
  modifies the given option(s) to have the given value(s); in this case
  *itemName* may refer to mulitple items (example: "all").  *Option* and
  *value* are described below.

  **-accelerator** *string* 
    Specifies a textual field to be displayed to the right of the label.
    The accelerator typically describes a keystroke sequence that may be
    typed in the application to cause the same result as invoking the menu

    Specifies one of three states for the item: 

    **normal**
      In normal state the item is displayed using the **-foreground**
      option for the menu and the **-background** option from
      the item or the menu.

    **disabled**
      Disabled state means that the item should be insensitive: the default
      bindings will not activate or invoke the item.  In this state
      the item is displayed according to the **-disabledforeground** option
      for the menu and the **-disabledbackground** option from the item.

    **hidden**
      The item is not displayed.

    The default is "normal".

  **-style** *styleName*

    description with the menu item. It is not used by the *combomenu*
    widget.  The default is "".

  **-type** *itemType* 
    Specifies the type of the menu item.  *Itemtype* can be "button",
    "cascade", "checkbutton", "radiobutton", or "separator". These
    menu types are described in the section `MENU ITEMS`_.
    The default is "button".

  **-underline** *charIndex* 
    Specifies the index of the character to be underlined when displaying
    menus item.  In addition the underlined character is used in the
    *combomenu* widget's bindings.  When the menu is posted and the key
    associated with the underlined character is pressed, the item is
    selected.  *CharIndex* is the index of the character in the label,
    starting from zero.  If *charIndex* is not a valid index, no character
    is underlined. The default is -1.

  **-value** *string* 
    Specifies the value to be stored in the item.  This is for cases where

  **-variable** *varName* 
    Specifies the name of a global TCL variable to set whenever this
    radionbutton item is selected.  Changes in *varName* also cause the
    item to select or deselect itself.  The default value is "".

*pathName* **listadd** *labelList*  ?\ *option* *value* ... ?
  Adds one or more menu items to the menu from *labelList*.  For each label
  in *labelList* a new menu item is created with that label.  A menu item
  can not already exist with the label.  If one or more *option-value*
  pairs are specified, they modify each created menu item with the given
  option(s) to have the given value(s).  *Option* and *value* are described
  in the **item configure** operation.

*pathName* **names** ?\ *pattern* ... ?
  Returns the labels of all the items in the menu.  If one or more
  *pattern* arguments are provided, then the label of any item matching
  *pattern* will be returned. *Pattern* is a **glob**\-style pattern.
  Matching is done in a fashion similar to that used by the TCL **glob**
  command.

*pathName* **nearest** *x* *y*
  Returns the index of the menu item closest to the coordinates specified.
  *X* and *y* are root coordinates.

*pathName* **next** *itemName* 
  Moves the focus to the next menu item from *itemName*.  *ItemName* may be
  a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu item.

*pathName* **overbutton** *x* *y* 
  Indicates if the x and y coordinates specified are over the button region
  for this menu.  *X* and *y* are root coordinates.  This command uses the
  information set by the **post** operation to determine where the button
  region is.  Returns "1" if the coordinate is in the button region, "0"
  otherwise.

*pathName* **post** ?\ *switches* ... ? 
  Arranges for the *pathName* to be displayed on the screen. The position
  of *pathName* depends upon *switches*.

  The position of the *combomenu* may be adjusted to guarantee that the
  entire widget is visible on the screen.  This command normally returns an
  empty string.  If the **-postcommand** option has been specified, then
  its value is executed as a TCL script before posting the menu and the
  result of that script is returned as the result of the post widget
  command.  If an error returns while executing the command, then the error
  is returned without posting the menu.

  *Switches* can be one of the following:

  **-align** *how*
    Aligns the menu horizontally to its parent according to *how*.  *How*
    can be "left", "center", or "right".

  **-box** *coordList*

    Normally combomenus are aligned to the parent window.  This allows you
    to align the menu a specific screen region.  *CoordList* is a list of
    two x,y coordinates pairs representing the two corners of the box.

  **-cascade** *coordList*
    Specifies how to position the menu.  This option is for
    *cascade* menus. *CoordList* is a list of x and y coordinates
    representing the position of the cascade menu.

    *popup* menus. *CoordList* is a list of x and y coordinates
    representing the position of the popup menu.

  **-window** *windowName*
    Specifies the name of window to align the menu to.  Normally
    *combomenu*s are aligned to its parent window.  *WindowName* is the
    name of another widget.

*pathName* **postcascade** ?\ *itemName*\ ? 
  Posts the the *combomenu* associated with *itemName* (the menu is
  specified by the **-menu** option for menu items). This command is only
  affects *cascade* items.  *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but
  may not represent more than one menu item.

*pathName* **previous** *itemName*
  Moves the focus to the previous menu item from *itemName*.  *ItemName*
  may be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu
  item.

*pathName* **reset** *itemName*
  Resets the menu to have *itemName* selected and in view.  *ItemName* may
  be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than one menu item.
  This operation might be used in the **-postcommand** command when you
  want to reuse the menu but want to have a specific item active and in
  view when it is posted.

*pathName* **scan dragto** *x* *y* This command computes the difference
  between *x* and *y* and the coordinates to the last **scan mark** command
  for the widget.  It then adjusts the view by 10 times the difference in
  coordinates.  This command is typically associated with mouse motion
  events in the widget, to produce the effect of dragging the item list at
  high speed through the window.  The return value is an empty string.
   
*pathName* **scan mark** *x* *y*
  Records *x* and *y* and the current view in the menu window; to be used
  with later **scan dragto** commands. *X* and *y* are window coordinates
  (i.e. relative to menu window).  Typically this command is associated
  with a mouse button press in the widget.  It returns an empty string.

*pathName* **see** *itemName* 
  Scrolls the menu so that *itemName* is visible in the widget's window.
  *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than
  one menu item.
  
*pathName* **select** *itemName* 
  Selects *itemName* in the menu. The item is drawn in its selected colors
  and its TCL command is invoked (see the **-command** menu item option).
  *ItemName* may be a label, index, or tag, but may not represent more than
  one menu item.
  
*pathName* **size**
  Returns the number of items in the menu.  
   
*pathName* **sort cget** *option*
  Returns the current value of the sort configuration option given by
  *option*. *Option* may have any of the values accepted by the **sort
  configure** operation. They are described below.

*pathName* **sort configure** ?\ *option*\ ? ?\ *value*\ ? ?\ *option* *value* ... ?
  Queries or modifies the sort configuration options.  If no *option* is
  specified, returns a list describing all the available options for
  *pathName* (see **Tk_ConfigureInfo** for information on the format of
  this list).  If *option* is specified with no *value*, then this command
  returns a list describing the one named option (this list will be
  identical to the corresponding sublist of the value returned if no
  *option* is specified).  If one or more *option-value* pairs are
  specified, then this command modifies the given sort option(s) to have
  the given value(s); in this case the command returns an empty string.
  *Option* and *value* are described below.

  **-auto** 
    Automatically resort the menu items anytime the items are added
    deleted, or changed.

  **-byvalue** 
    Sort items using their values.  By default the items are sorted
    by their labels.

  **-command** *cmdPrefix*
    Specifies *cmdPrefix* as a prefix to a TCL command to use for comparing
    items.  To compare two items, evaluate a TCL script consisting of
    command with the two item appended as additional arguments.  The script
    should return an integer less than, equal to, or greater than zero if
    the first item is to be considered less than, equal to, or greater than
    the second, respectively.

  **-decreasing** 
    Sort the items highest to lowest. By default items are sorted
    lowest to highest.

  **-type** *sortType*
    Compare items based upon *sortType*.  *SortType* can be
    any of the following:

    **ascii**
      Use string comparison with Unicode code-point collation order (the name
      is for backward-compatibility reasons.)  The string representation of
      the values are compared.   

    **dictionary**
      Use dictionary-style comparison. This is the same as *ascii*
      except (a) case is ignored except as a tie-breaker and (b) if two
      strings contain embedded numbers, the numbers compare as integers,
      not characters.  For example, in -dictionary mode, "bigBoy" sorts
      between "bigbang" and "bigboy", and "x10y" sorts between "x9y" and
      "x11y".  

    **integer**
      Compare the items as integers.  

    **real**
      Compare the items as floating point numbers.  

    *command*

  the **style create** operaton.  *Option* may be any option described
  below for the **style configure** operation.
   
*pathName* **style configure** *styleName* ?\ *option* *value* ... ?
  Queries or modifies the configuration options for the style *styleName*.
  *StyleName* is the name of a style created by the **style create**
  operaton.  If no *option* argument is specified, this command returns a
  list describing all the available options for *pathName* (see
  **Tk_ConfigureInfo** for information on the format of this list).  If
  *option* is specified with no *value*, then the command returns a list
  describing the one named option (this list will be identical to the
  corresponding sublist of the value returned if no *option* is specified).
  If one or more *option-value* pairs are specified, then this command
  modifies the given widget option(s) to have the given value(s); in this
  case the command returns an empty string.  *Option* and *value* are
  described below.

DEFAULT BINDINGS
----------------

There are many default class bindings for *combomenu* widgets.

EXAMPLE
-------

Create a *combomenu* widget with the **blt::combomenu** command.

 ::

    package require BLT

    # Create a new combomenu and add menu items to it.

    blt::combobutton .file -text "File" -menu .file.m \
      -xscrollbar .file.xs \
      -yscrollbar .file.ys 

    blt::combomenu .file.m 
    .file.m add -text "New Window" -accelerator "Ctrl+N" -underline 0 \
        -icon $image(new_window)
    .file.m add -text "New Tab" -accelerator "Ctrl+T" -underline 4 \
        -icon $icon(new_tab)
    .file.m add -text "Open Location..." -accelerator "Ctrl+L" -underline 5
    .file.m add -text "Open File..." -accelerator "Ctrl+O" -underline 0 \
       -icon $icon(open_file)
    .file.m add -text "Close Window" -accelerator "Ctrl+Shift+W" -underline 9
    .file.m add -text "Close Tab" -accelerator "Ctrl+W" -underline 0
    blt::tk::scrollbar .file.ysbar 
    blt::tk::scrollbar .file.xsbar 

Please note the following:

1. You can't use a Tk **menubutton** with *combomenu*\ s.  The menu is
   posted by either a **blt::combobutton** or **blt::comboentry**
   widget.

2. You specify scrollbar widgets with the **-xscrollbar** and
   **-yscrollbar** options.  The scrollbars do not already have to exist.

3. You create menu items with the **add** operation.  The type of item is
   specified by the **-type** option.  The default type is "button".

4. You don't pack the scrollbars.  This is done for you.

5. You don't have to specify the **-orient** or **-command** options to
   the scrollbars. This is done for you.


DIFFERENCES WITH TK MENUS
-------------------------

The **blt::combomenu** widget has several differences with the Tk **menu**
widget.

1. *Combomenu* item types are specified by the **-type** option.

2. *Combomenus* can not be torn off.

3. *Combomenus* can not be invoked by a Tk **menubutton**.

4. *Combomenus* are a single column.
