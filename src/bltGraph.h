 *
 *	Same goes for maintaining a pixmap to double buffer graph elements.
 *	Need to mark when the pixmap needs to updated.
 *
 *
 *	MAP_ITEM		Indicates that the element/marker/axis

 *				position in the graph window) needs
 *				to be recalculated.
 *
 *	MAP_ALL			Indicates that the layout of the axes and

 *
 *	GET_AXIS_GEOMETRY	Indicates that the size of the axes needs

 *	RESET_AXES		Flag to call to Blt_ResetAxes routine.  
 *				This routine recalculates the scale offset
 *				(used for mapping coordinates) of each axis.
 *				If an axis limit has changed, then it sets

 *				used for buffering elements. 
 *
 *	REDRAW_PENDING		Non-zero means a DoWhenIdle handler has

 *
 *	DRAW_LEGEND		Non-zero means redraw the legend. If this is 
 *				the only DRAW_* flag, the legend display 
 *				routine is called instead of the graph 
 *				display routine. 
 *
 *	DRAW_MARGINS		Indicates that the margins bordering 
 *				the plotting area need to be redrawn. 
 *				The possible reasons are:
 *
 *				1) an axis configuration changed
 *				2) an axis limit changed
 *				3) titles have changed
